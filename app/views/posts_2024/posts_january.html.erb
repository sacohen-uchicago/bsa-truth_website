<h2> Wars in the Middle East<h2>
<h3>By Seth Cohen, 20240101</h3>
<p>
The involvement of the United States in the Syrian Civil War, spanning from 2005 to 2020, is a complex and multifaceted narrative intertwined with international politics, regional conflicts, and the global fight against terrorism.
<br/>
<strong>**Early Stages (2005-2011):**</strong> Prior to 2011, the United States' involvement in Syria was primarily diplomatic and political. America, under the Bush and later the Obama administrations, imposed various sanctions on the Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad, due to human rights abuses and support for terrorist organizations. These sanctions were aimed at isolating the Assad regime internationally.
<br/>
<strong>**Arab Spring and Escalation (2011-2014):**</strong> The situation changed dramatically with the advent of the Arab Spring in 2011. Peaceful protests against the Assad regime quickly turned into a full-blown civil war. The U.S., initially hesitant to get directly involved, condemned the Assad regime's use of violence against protesters and called for Assad's resignation. During this period, America's involvement was mainly through diplomatic channels, pushing for a political solution to the conflict.
<br/>
<strong>**Rise of ISIS and U.S. Intervention (2014-2016):**</strong> The emergence of the Islamic State (ISIS) as a dominant force in the region in 2014 marked a significant shift in U.S. policy. The U.S. led an international coalition to conduct airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria. This marked the first direct military intervention by the U.S. in the conflict. The Obama administration also began providing limited support to select rebel groups fighting against both the Assad regime and ISIS.
<br/>
<strong>**Trump Administration and Continued Involvement (2017-2020):**</strong> Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. continued its fight against ISIS, culminating in the capture of the last ISIS stronghold in Syria in 2019. However, the Trump administration had a more ambivalent stance towards the Assad regime and signaled a reduced interest in Syrian internal politics. The U.S. involvement during this period remained focused on counterterrorism operations and supporting Kurdish forces in the region.
<br/>
<strong>**Humanitarian and Political Efforts:**</strong> Throughout this period, the U.S. was also involved in humanitarian efforts, providing aid to Syrian refugees and displaced persons. Diplomatically, America participated in various international forums and peace talks aimed at resolving the conflict, though these efforts largely remained unsuccessful due to the complex web of interests and alliances in the region.
<br/>
<strong>**Controversies and Criticisms:**</strong> The U.S.'s involvement in Syria has been subject to various criticisms. These include the legality of its military intervention without explicit UN approval, the effectiveness and ethics of supporting rebel groups, and the limited success in bringing about a political solution to the conflict. 
<br/>
<strong>**Conclusion:**</strong> The American involvement in the Syrian Civil War was marked by a cautious approach initially, which evolved into direct military action primarily against ISIS. The U.S.'s role was significant in combating ISIS but less effective in resolving the broader Syrian conflict, reflecting the complexities of Middle Eastern politics and the limitations of American influence in the region.
